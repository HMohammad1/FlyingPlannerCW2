# FlyingPlanner CW2

This program implements the JGraphT library to sort out flight information and to get different flight details between two airports such as cost, how many airports to go through before arriving at the destination and displaying all this data in a nice way. 

To use this in your IDE locate the 'FlyingPlannerMainPartBC.java' class. Run this and you will be prompted with the start airport. In the FlightsDataset directory you will find airports.csv. In here you can use any airport but be sure to only use the abreviated version of the airport and all caps. You can then enter the destination airport in this format when promted.

You will then have a number of options to choose from and can follow the on screen prompts.
